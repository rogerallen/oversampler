# oversampler

A Clojure library for adjusting & playing music samples in the Overtone project.

## TODO List

    X get basic division of code
      X analysis of samples, view samples
      X bank - to load samples for future use
      X inst - the instrument of course
    X cello notes need some processing
      X alignment
        - C2 shows noise before initial attack, delaying start.  
          found start point via midpoint of 90th percentile volume
      X add fade-in/out from/to 0
      X find normalized volume
      ? make each same length?    
    X code is too "cello" centric.
    X upload cello sounds to freesound & adjust interface
    O fix so volume is not discreet in 3 steps
    O cello sounds need a good ear to listen/critique/adjust
    O needs better docs
