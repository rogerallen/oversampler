# oversampler

A Clojure library for adjusting & playing music samples in the Overtone project.

## TODO List

    X get basic division of code
      X analysis of samples, view samples
      X bank - to load samples for future use
      X inst - the instrument of course
    / cello notes need some processing
      X alignment
        - C2 shows noise before initial attack, delaying start.  
          found start point via midpoint of 90th percentile volume
      O add fade-in/out from/to 0
      O find normalized volume
      ? make each same length?
    O upload cello sounds to freesound & adjust interface
    O code is too "cello" centric.  Needs abstraction

## Usage

Code is under development.  Use at your own risk.

Here are some things that you can do:

First, download http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIScello2012.html
Cello.arco.mono.1644.1.zip and unzip into the src/oversampler/samples directory.

    ;; use this to create & print the information to go into bank/cello-sample-info-list
    (print-all-info cello-sample-paths)

    ;; use Incanter graphs to look over one of the samples
    (view-sample "./src/oversampler/samples/Cello.arco.ff.sulA.A3Ab4.mono.aif")
    (view-sample (nth (nth cello-sample-paths 3) 2))

    ;; play a sample from a file
    (defn play-sample [path samp-start samp-end]
      (let [size (- samp-end samp-start)]
        (sample-player
         (load-sample path :start samp-start :size size))))
    (play-sample "./src/oversampler/samples/Cello.arco.ff.sulA.A3Ab4.mono.aif" 2734200 2994390)
  
    ;; hear a sample from the loaded examples
    (sample-player (get-cello-sample (note :c3) 1.0) :vol 8)
    (sample-player (get-cello-sample (note :c3) 0.5) :vol 8)
    (sample-player (get-cello-sample (note :c3) 0.3) :vol 8)

    ;; use the instrument
    (do
      (sampled-cello :note (note :c3))
      (sampled-cello :note (note :e3))
      (sampled-cello :note (note :g3)))
