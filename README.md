# oversampler

A Clojure library for adjusting & playing music samples in the Overtone project.

## Usage

### Cello Instrument

The sampled-cello is usable at this point, but could use review from others for tuning and guidance on the best way to map the samples to volumes.  

Basic use via:

    (use 'oversampler.cello.inst)
    (sampled-cello :note 50 :level 0.5)
    
There are 3 sets of samples soft (pp), medium (mf) and loud (ff).  By default only the mf samples are used.  If you want all 3 sets of samples, try something like:

    (sampled-cello-init :pp-volume-cutoff 0.30 :mf-volume-cutoff 0.85)
    (sampled-cello :note 50 :level 0.2) ;; pp sample
    (sampled-cello :note 50 :level 0.5) ;; mf sample
    (sampled-cello :note 50 :level 0.9) ;; ff sample

### Analysis

Analysis code is under development & doesn't have any docs.  See
core.clj comments for other things you can do with the code.  It is
also commented out for normal distribution, since it uses Incanter and
that's not something normal sample players should need.

## TODO List

    o cello sounds need review by others for loudness, tuning, etc.
    o needs better docs
